# PUSH-NOTIFICATION-FOR-ANDROID
PUSH NOTIFICATION FOR ANDROID


1. SETUP OVERVIEW
   
Client-Side (React Native): Applications (Android/iOS) will capture and send
device tokens to your backend.

Backend (AWS Lambda): An API Gateway-triggered Lambda function will
receive device tokens, register them with AWS SNS, and store the resulting
Endpoint ARNs user information in a database/any where you want.

Notification Delivery: When API triggers The Lambda function will then use SNS to send push
notifications to all users belonging to the specified teams.

2. REACT NATIVE: DEVICE TOKEN REGISTRATION
   
To obtain the device token, you can use libraries like @react-nativefirebase/messaging . Upon application startup or when a token refresh
event occurs, call your Lambda API endpoint /registerDevice with the
following payload:
{
 "userId": "user123",
 "deviceToken": "token_from_fcm_or_apns",
 "platform": "android" or "ios"
}

3. LAMBDA FUNCTION: REGISTER DEVICE AND SEND NOTIFICATIONS Prerequisites
   
IAM Role: Ensure your Lambda function's IAM role has permissions for
SNS:CreatePlatformEndpoint and SNS:Publish .
SNS Platform Application ARNs: You must have configured Platform
Application ARNs for both Android (FCM) and iOS (APNS) within SNS.

4. NOTES & BEST PRACTICES

Token Management: Implement logic to handle device token updates. If a
token changes, re-register the device.

Large-Scale Notifications: For broadcasting notifications to a very large
audience, explore AWS SNS Topic mechanisms, where devices subscribe to
topics representing teams or user segments.

Monitoring and Error Handling: Integrate AWS CloudWatch for logging and
monitoring Lambda function execution and potential errors.

API Security: Secure your API Gateway endpoints with appropriate
authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., IAM, Cognito, or custom
authorizers).
